/// A thread-safe Relay for posting callbacks to an Event loop.
///
/// Creating a Relay keeps the Event loop alive until the Relay is
/// destroyed.
///
/// A default-constructed or moved-from Relay is inert: send() is a
/// safe no-op, and destruction has no effect.
///
/// Usage (one-shot):
///   auto Relay = loop.create_relay();
///   some_system_async_api([Relay = std::move(Relay)](auto result) mutable {
///       Relay.send([result] { /* runs on loop thread */ });
///   });
///
/// Usage (recurring):
///   Relay notify = loop.create_relay();
///   // from any thread, repeatedly:
///   notify.send([&] { drain_buffer(); });
///   // destroy the Relay (or let it go out of scope) to release the loop hold.
///
/// Ownership:
///   The Relay object is single-owner and non-copyable. send() is
///   thread-safe with respect to other send() calls, but the Relay
///   must not be destroyed while any send() call is in progress.
///
/// Lifetime:
///   The EventLoop must outlive all relays created from it. Using a
///   Relay after its EventLoop is destroyed is undefined behavior.
///
/// Thread safety:
///   - Construction (create_relay) is NOT thread-safe; call it on the
///     loop thread before handing the Relay off.
///   - send() is thread-safe and can be called multiple times.
///   - Destroying the Relay releases the loop hold. PENDING callbacks
///     that were already enqueued are still delivered, unless the
///     EventLoop itself is being destroyed (which clears the queue).
